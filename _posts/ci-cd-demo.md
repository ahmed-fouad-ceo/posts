ðŸš€ **Welcome to my first GitHub Pages post!**

Today marks the beginning of my DevOps learning journey.  
I set up a full **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions and Azure Static Web Apps â€”  
and even automated the commit SHA injection into the deployed page!

### ðŸ’¡ What I learned
- How GitHub Actions automates deployment.
- How Azure Static Web Apps connects directly to your repository.
- How to inject the commit hash into HTML using `sed`.

### ðŸ”— Whatâ€™s Next
Next, Iâ€™ll be posting tutorials, screenshots, and real CI/CD tips.  
Stay tuned for updates â€” and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](#)!
