ðŸš€ **Today I finished building my first full CI/CD pipeline** â€” and it works like magic.

This project connects **GitHub Actions** with **Azure Static Web Apps**, so every time I push a change to the `main` branch, the website automatically rebuilds and redeploys. No manual uploads. No FTP. Just code â†’ commit â†’ live.

## ðŸ§± Step 1: Project Setup

I created a simple `index.html` file to serve as the static site.

```html
<h1>ðŸš€ CI/CD Demo: Azure Static Web App</h1>
<p>This site automatically redeploys on every push to <code>main</code>.</p>
<footer><small><!-- COMMIT_SHA --></small></footer>
