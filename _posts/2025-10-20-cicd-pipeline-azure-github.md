ðŸš€ **Today I completed my first CI/CD pipeline** â€” and itâ€™s fully automated!

This project links **GitHub Actions** with **Azure Static Web Apps** so every push to `main` automatically builds and deploys the new version.

## ðŸ§± Step 1: Project Setup

I started with a minimal static site:

```html
<h1>ðŸš€ CI/CD Demo: Azure Static Web App</h1>
<p>This site automatically redeploys on every push to <code>main</code>.</p>
<footer><small><!-- COMMIT_SHA --></small></footer>
